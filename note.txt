ok, so 
cards have ...2 forms

playable form and storage form

since when player reprogram, the cached storage form is accessed, edit, then turn back to playable form
players do not edit the current playing deck, player edits the deck they last leave the edit screen with

aka
i think we need to implement jkong's data format for deck storage


zones need more responsibilities
specificaly the "knocking on doors" ability

2 methods - can respond and respond (respond returns res, put an "effect activate" action of every card in teh zone)
a lot of methods more for the payment step

system then, have no cards but can respond to specific actions like "card health hit 0" for example


action cycle is this:
turn start 
-> player input 
-> ask zone for an action 
-> attach that action to the tree 
-> while tree is not empty: 
-> -> resolve action
-> end turn, repeat

-> resolve action:
-> -> (declares) get a node
-> -> (chain) ask zone if anything responds during the chain phase
-> -> (resolve) ask zone to handle the resulting action
-> -> (trigger) ask zone again for anything that responds
-> -> while nextNode is not this one
-> -> -> resolve action
-> -> mark current node as completed

asking for user input is treated as a chained action, which modifies the original action
