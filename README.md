# qpRemake
remake of the qp engine, with moddability in mind

# Current tasks:
- finish the "card" object
- port the old data over to the new format
- add reprogram functionality
- add easier support for graphical events (may need to modify main loop to be async) (dangerous update)
- program every single card in the game
